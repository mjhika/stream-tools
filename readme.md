# stream-tools

This project is largely a toy. I want to improve the quality of my stream with a fun feature set and I want to improve my coding abilities. This tool serves as the project to do both of those things.

### Goals

- [ ] make animations for the stream
- [ ] make a websockets client for OBS to control OBS through Clojure
- [ ] make a twitch bot that can react to events in the chat

# Layout

This project is built with the polylith tool. I like the format and the documentation of the monolith methodology.
